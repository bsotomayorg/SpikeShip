# SpikeShip: A method for fast, unsupervised discovery of high-dimensional neural spiking patterns.

The Python 3 module `spikeship` which implements the fast, unsupervised dissimilarity measure described in Sotomayor-GÃ³mez, B., L., Battaglia, F. and Vinck, M. (2023). "SpikeShip: A method for fast, unsupervised discovery of high-dimensional neural spiking patterns". [Article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011335), *PLoS CB*.

## Setup
The dependencies can be installed by running `./env_setup.sh <ENV_NAME>` with the optional argument specifying the target environment (which must be source-able). To setup the module, run `python setup.py install`. A jupyter notebook is available in `notebooks/`, along with a demo dataset, showing an example workflow for the SpikeShip methods and its comparison with SPOTDis.

### Linux (Anaconda)
1) `conda create -n spikeship python=3`
1) `./env_setup.sh spikeship`
1) `source activate spikeship`
1) `python setup.py install`

### Windows (Anaconda)
1) `conda create -n spikeship python=3.6.5`
1) `conda activate spikeship`
1) `conda install numba`
1) `conda install ipykernel`
1) `conda install matplotlib`
1) `conda install scikit-learn`
1) `conda install joblib`
1) `python setup.py install`


## Further notes
The software requirements/dependencies are the same from the work ![SPOTDis](https://github.com/LGro/spot), the implementation of the Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity described in Grossberger, L., Battaglia, F. and Vinck, M. (2018). Unsupervised clustering of temporal patterns in high-dimensional neuronal ensembles using a novel dissimilarity measure. *PLoS CB.*
