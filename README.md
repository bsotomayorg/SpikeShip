# SpikeShip: A method for fast, unsupervised discovery of high-dimensional neural spiking patterns.

A Python 3 module called `spikeship` which implements the fast, unsupervised discovery of high-dimensional neural spiking patterns based on optimal transport theory described in Sotomayor-GÃ³mez, B., L., Battaglia, F. and Vinck, M. (2022). "SpikeShip: A method for fast, unsupervised discovery of high-dimensional neural spiking patterns". ![DOI:10.1101/2020.06.03.131573v3](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.03.131573v3).

## Setup
The dependencies can be installed by running `./env_setup.sh <ENV_NAME>` with the optional argument specifying the target environment (which must be source-able). To setup the module, run `python setup.py install`. A jupyter notebook is available in `notebooks/`, along with a demo dataset, showing an example workflow for the SpikeShip methods and its comparison with SPOTDis.

## Further notes
The software requirements/dependencies are the same from the work ![SPOTDis](https://github.com/LGro/spot), the implementation of the Spike Pattern Optimal Transport Dissimilarity described in Grossberger, L., Battaglia, F. and Vinck, M. (2018). Unsupervised clustering of temporal patterns in high-dimensional neuronal ensembles using a novel dissimilarity measure. *PLoS Comput. Biol.*
